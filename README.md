# Python and Ethical Hacking - zSecurity Course Projects

Welcome to the **Python and Ethical Hacking** repository! This repository contains Python scripts and projects that I developed while completing the Udemy course **"Learn Python & Ethical Hacking From Scratch"** by zSecurity.

This course provided a hands-on introduction to ethical hacking, using Python to create tools commonly used in the cybersecurity industry. This repository includes the code from each module, allowing others to explore the concepts covered and apply them to their own learning.

## About the Course

The **Python and Ethical Hacking** course by zSecurity is a beginner-friendly course designed to introduce Python programming in the context of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. The course covers various topics, such as:
- Basic programming concepts and Python fundamentals
- Network scanning and information gathering
- Writing ethical hacking tools from scratch
- Scripting automated attacks and penetration tests

## Projects Included

This repository contains the following projects and scripts:

1. **Port Scanner**: Scans open ports on a target machine.
2. **Network Sniffer**: Monitors and logs network traffic.
3. **MAC Address Changer**: Script to change a device's MAC address.
4. **ARP Spoofer**: Conducts ARP spoofing to intercept data.
5. **Keylogger**: Records keystrokes in the background.
6. **Brute-force Attack Scripts**: Various brute-force examples targeting common protocols.
7. **Other Tools**: Additional smaller tools and scripts for penetration testing.

Each project is stored in a separate folder with detailed comments explaining the code and its functionality.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd Udemy-python-and-ethical-hacking-course-codes
   ```


## Usage

Each project can be run as an independent script. To execute a script, navigate to the corresponding project directory and run it with Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

### Example:
To run the **Port Scanner**:
```bash
cd port-scanner
python port_scanner.py
```

Refer to the comments within each script for details on command-line options and required parameters.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational purposes **only**. The scripts here are intended to help users learn about ethical hacking techniques and Python programming in a cybersecurity context. Do **not** use these tools on any system without explicit permission, as doing so may be illegal and against ethical hacking guidelines.
